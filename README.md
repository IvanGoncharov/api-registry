## Documentation

Coming soon, for now, see the [APIs.guru Wiki](https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/wiki/Development)

## TODO

- Consider moving metadata store from yaml to [Acebase](https://github.com/appy-one/acebase)

### Considerations

- Acebase doesn't like empty keys - as per our default serviceNames
- Acebase doesn't like keys containing `\ / [ ]` which can trip up some metadata patches
